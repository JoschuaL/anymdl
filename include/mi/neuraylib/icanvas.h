/// which might have any color.

/// A pixel at position (\c canvas_pixel_x, \c canvas_pixel_y) of the canvas belongs to the
/// tile (\c tile_number_x, \c tile_number_y) where \c tile_number_x and \c tile_number_y are
/// computed as follows:
/// \code
///     tile_number_x = canvas_pixel_x / get_tile_resolution_x()
///     tile_number_y = canvas_pixel_y / get_tile_resolution_y()
/// \endcode
///
/// Within this tile the pixel has the coordinates (\c tile_pixel_x, \c tile_pixel_y) which are
/// computed as follows
/// \code
///     tile_pixel_x = canvas_pixel_x % get_tile_resolution_x()
///     tile_pixel_y = canvas_pixel_y % get_tile_resolution_y()
/// \endcode

/// Optionally, there can be multiple layers of such tile arrays. The number of these layers is
/// given by #mi::neuraylib::ICanvas_base::get_layers_size(). The format a layer, i.e., the type of
