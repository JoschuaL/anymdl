/*! \page mi_neuray_examples Tutorial and Example Programs

We provide several examples for the use of the \neurayApiName
that illustrate -- in a tutorial manner -- the important
interfaces and concepts. See the \ref mi_neuray_getting_started
Section for a description of how the example programs can be compiled.

\section mi_neuray_examples_getting_started Getting Started with \neurayProductName

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_start_shutdown <br>
  Starts and shuts down the \neurayApiName.

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_modules <br>
  Loads an MDL module and inspects its contents.

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_instantiation <br>
  Instantiates material and function definitions.

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_calls <br>
  Creates a textured material via a series of function calls.

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_compilation <br>
  Class and instance compilation of material instances.

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_code_gen <br>
  Generating HLSL, GLSL, or PTX code for a compiled material.

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_execution_native <br>
  Executes material sub-expressions of a compiled MDL material for the native (CPU) backend.

- \subpage mi_neuray_example_execution_ptx <br>
